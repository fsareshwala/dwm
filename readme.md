dwm - dynamic window manager
----------------------------
This repository houses my fork of `dwm`, a dynamic tiling window manager for X.

Patches
-------
I have applied the following patches in this repository:

- [fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps): adds gaps between client windows
- [scratchpad](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/scratchpad): spawn or restore a floating terminal
  window. It is usually useful to have one to do some short typing.
